# Smart AI Waste Segregator

## üìå Project Overview
The product is an intelligent waste segregation system that uses machine learning and embedded systems to categorize waste into **recyclable** and **non-recyclable** categories. It utilizes an **ESP32-CAM module** for image processing, an **ultrasonic sensor** for waste detection, and a **servo motor** for directing the waste into respective compartments. The system enhances waste management efficiency and promotes eco-friendly disposal practices.

## üèôÔ∏è Smart Cities & Waste Management
The Smart AI Bin plays a vital role in Smart Cities by improving waste management through AI-driven automation. By efficiently segregating waste and reducing landfill overflow, it supports sustainability goals and promotes eco-friendly urban development. The IoT-enabled monitoring system ensures optimized collection schedules, reducing operational costs and carbon footprints. Integrating such solutions into smart city infrastructure fosters cleaner environments, efficient resource utilization, and a more sustainable future.
